#  **AI - Powered Retail Sales Forecasting**

A clean, practical forecasting project built with **Python** and visualized through **Power BI**, designed for real-world retail analytics use-cases.

This project predicts **monthly store sales** using historical data from the **Rossmann Store Sales** competition on Kaggle.

# **Objective**

Build a **forecasting system** that can help retail managers answer:

* How will sales behave in the next months?
* Are sales trending upward or downward?
* Which periods show seasonality?
* How uncertain is the forecast?
* How should inventory & staffing adjust?

---

# **Dataset**

**Source:** Rossmann Store Sales (Kaggle)
Contains:
* Daily sales
* Open/Closed indicator
* Promotions
* Store metadata
* Competitor information

For forecasting, we aggregate sales to **monthly total across all stores**.

# **Tools & Technologies**

| Component     | Tools Used                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Forecasting   | Prophet (Facebook)                |
| Data Prep     | Pandas, NumPy                     |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Power BI              |
| Modeling      | Scikit-learn metrics (MAE / RMSE) |
| Notebook      | Jupyter                           |
| Versioning    | Git + GitHub                      |

# **Methodology (Short, Clear, Interview-Ready)**

### **1. Load & Merge Data**

* train.csv + store.csv
* Remove closed days (Open = 0)
* Remove zero-sales entries
* Keep only required columns

### **2. Aggregate to Monthly Series**

Daily → Monthly using:

```python
df.resample("M")["Sales"].sum()
```

Prophet prefers clean, stable monthly trends.

### **3. Train–Holdout Split**

* Last 6 months held out for evaluation
* Remaining used for training

### **4. Prophet Model**

Configured with:

* yearly_seasonality=True
* weekly_seasonality=False
* daily_seasonality=False

### **5. Evaluation**

Using MAE + RMSE.

**Final performance:**

```
MAE  = 34,977,653
RMSE = 42,483,831
```

This is expected for aggregated retail sales with large magnitudes.

### **6. Export for Power BI**

A unified CSV used by dashboard:

| date | actual | forecast | lower | upper |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ----- | ----- |

Saved to:

```
output/forecast_output.csv
```

---

# **What the Power BI Dashboard Includes**

The dashboard contains:

###  Actual vs Forecast line chart

Shows base trend + future predictions.

###  Confidence interval (lower–upper)

Represents uncertainty in the forecast.

###  Seasonality view

Month-over-month pattern extracted from Prophet.

###  KPI Cards

* Next month forecast
* Expected YoY change
* Highest predicted month
* Lowest predicted month

###  Filters

* Date

---

# **Insights From the Forecast**

Based on the aggregated Rossmann monthly sales:

* Clear **yearly seasonality**
* Sales dip mid-year and peak in Q4
* Forecast shows **moderate upward trend**
* Promotion periods match sales spikes
* Uncertainty band widens over time (normal for Prophet)
* Useful for **inventory planning**, **cashflow** and **staffing**

---

# **How to Run the Entire Pipeline**

### **1. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install pandas numpy prophet matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### **2. Run the notebook**

```bash
notebooks/01_forecasting.ipynb
```

### **3. Get output CSV**

File generated at:

```
output/forecast_output.csv
```

### **4. Load into Power BI**

* Home → Get Data → CSV
* Select `forecast_output.csv`
* Build visuals
* Save dashboard in `powerbi/`
